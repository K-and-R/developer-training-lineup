# Developer Training Lineup

This page provides information about how to study the material in this
series of courses. It includes some helful tips regarding how to study these courses for maximum retention and ease of use.

## Beginning At The Beginning

Often it has been said of software development
that "anyone can do it!". Just amongst us girls, that's not entirely true.
It's not as easy as the boys on YouTube seem to make it out to be.
In fact, their constant assertion that it's "soooo easy" is not only just a bit deceptive,
it's also a denigration of all the hard work put in by the successful developers working in the business today.
There is quite a lot to know in order to be successful as a software developer.
This course endeavors to teach the new developer all of the basic tools needed to work on develpoment projects successfully.

Some of these skills include:

* An understanding of computer hardware.
* How to set-up your work space on the computer.
* The ability to navigate and utilize various software tools.
* Knowledge of the file storage system of the computer.
* Understanding how different programs communicate with each other.
* What is the internet?
* Servers and how to use them.
* Security of your software.
* Dependencies - What they are and why you need them.
* What is a library?
* What is a framework?
* What is an Intergrated Development Environment (IDE)
* How does all this stuff fit together?

The above list is certainly not all there is to know, but it is a good place to start.

### A Different Approach

  Any skill developed by anyone ever in the history of doing stuff knows
  that it all begins with the basics. Now, that may seem to be obvious. Common sense, right?
  But what, exactly, does the word "basic" mean anyway?
  Does basic mean "a fundamental command of the language"?  Does it mean "simple configuration of your IDE"?
  Or maybe it means "A knowledge of simple object destructuring syntax".
  Well, that's a "no" on all three counts.
  The word "basic" means "forming an essential foundation or starting point; fundamental" That's right out of the dictionary.
  So, by basic we mean things like "What is a computer?" and "What does it do?" and "Why do we need them?".
  Some may instantly scoff at this as overly simplistic.
  But if they were being really honest with themselves,
  they would see that there was a time when they could not answer these questions.
  Granted, for many, these questions were answered very early on in their careers.
  And for quite a few, these things were known to them from the time they were children.
  However, the point is there was a beginning, a starting point.

## How to Study this Course

  There are a few tips that have proven to be enourmously helpful in gaining, and retaining,
  an understanding of key principles presented in this series of courses.
  Some of these could be considered counter-intuitive, but rest assured, they work!
  And, even better, there are only three. Please take a look at each one, in turn.

## A Concept of Space

In the computer programming universe, we often refer to "things" in "spaces".
The truth is, there is really no such thing as a space or a thing.
Everything is really just a series of electronic impulses in that box called a computer.
Referring to these impulses as "things" and "spaces" is a way to translate
electricity flowing in the computer into something a human can understand.
In this way, a programmer can envision the relationships between one "thing" and another "thing".
A programmer can gain further understanding by knowing where the "thing lives".
In other words, it answers where a particular piece of software or program is located in relation to some other piece.
This relationship would define the program's "space".

## The Use of Real World Modeling

In order to simulate programs and the spaces in which they live it is recommended that the student use actual objects.
These objects are placed on a table or desk in positions that simulate the relationship of each thing to any other thing.
The objects used can be anything so long as they are solid and easily moveable.
Objects like pen caps, small blocks of wood, glass beads, etc.
By modeling programs and their spaces in the real world the student can
rapidly gain an understanding of how programs are supposed to work
and their relationship to other programs and processes occurring within the computer.

Any process, activity, relationship, or object can be modeled using the above technique.
In conjunction with a couple of other techniques the student can quickly understand and retain information presented to them.
In fact, even the actions within a program itself can be modeled in this way.
Real world modeling is essential to quickly and easily make sense out of what may seem to be quite a confusing mess.

## The Meaning of Words

All through the years of education experienced by most, if not all of us, teachers and parents
didn't place much emphasis the definition of words.
Many of us were taught to "figure it out" as we went along.
Or we were told what something meant by a teacher, parent or fellow classmate.
Even worse, we were sometimes forced to simply infer or take a good guess at what a word meant.
This has been a hidden source of trouble for many.

How would a teacher know what a word meant? How did your classmates know? What if your best guess was wrong?
How would you know what a word actually meant?  The simple answer is to use a dictionary.
Yes, that's right, look it up in a dictionary.
Many, many students have concieved themselves to be "stupid" or "slow".
But the fact is, they simply didn't understand all the words!
Once the words are found and looked up in a good dictionary these same students are found to be very bright and capable.
For some reason, there appears to be a sort of odd social stigma to looking up words in a dictionary.
However, unless you can guarantee that every person who ever told you what a word meant was
infallible in their command of the language
and every inferrence you ever made about the meaning of a word was equally infallible, it is likely
that you could benefit greatly from seeing for yourself *exactly and precisely* what a word means.
Dictionaries are great for accomplishing just that.

Whenever you find yourself feeling confused in the course of your studies it is recommended that you
stop and look around for a word(s) that you did not fully understand.
And here's a hint: *The word you didn't understand is usually not something technical or complicated.
*It's usually a word you've heard your whole life!*

## Too Much, Too Fast

In the study of any subject there is usually a lot to know. No one gets it in a minute.
Every student has their own pace that is comfortable for them. Some move fast and some a bit slower.
At the end of the day, everyone gets there.
Sometimes a student can feel like he doesn't know anything at all despite having studied for a long time.
This is a symptom of too much too fast.
Every student needs to find the pace they themselves are comfortable with.
When they inadvertantly surpass that pace, they can find themselves feeling like they don't actually know anything at all.
If the student finds himself unable to actually do what he has been taught he can be confident that he has surpassed
his own personal pace of study.
The thing to do is to go back to where he *knew* how to do what he learned and proceed from that point forward.

## The Goals of this Course

The primary goal of Level 00 Tools of the Trade is to familiarize the student with the basic objects connected with and actions
of using a computer.
This is truly a course for anyone who "knows nothing about computers". When you are done with this course you will know:

* What is a computer
* How does it work
* What are the parts of a computer
* How do I control this thing?

And a lot more.

You can attain these skills, no matter who you are or whether you have any previous knowledge of computers.
It is crucial to the future of this industry that you do.

Good Luck!
