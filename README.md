## Beginning At The Beginning

   Often it has been said of software development that "anyone can do it!". Just amongst us girls, that's not entirely true.    
       It's not as easy as the boys on YouTube seem to make it out to be. In fact, their constant assertion that it's "soooo easy" is not only just a bit deceptive, it's also a denigration of all the hard work put in by the successful developers working in the business today.  
        So, what does it really take to be successful in this industry? This series of courses endeavours to answer that question.

## A Different Approach

  Any skill developed by anyone ever in the history of doing stuff knows that it all begins with the basics. Now, that may seem to be obvious. Common sense, right? But what, exactly, does the word "basic" mean anyway? Does basic mean "a fundamental command of the language"?  Does it mean "simple configuration of your IDE"?
  Or maybe it means "A knowledge of simple object destructuring syntax".
  Well, that's a "no" on all three counts. 
  
  The word "basic" means "forming an essential foundation or starting point; fundamental" That's right out of the dictionary. So, by basic we mean things like "What is a computer?" and "What does it do?" and "Why do we need them?".  
  Some may instantly scoff at this as overly simplistic. But if they were being really honest with themselves, they would see that there was a time when they could not answer these questions. Granted, for many, these questions were answered very early on in their careers. And for quite a few, these things were known to them from the time they were children. However, the point is there was a beginning, a starting point. 

  ## The Goals of this Course
