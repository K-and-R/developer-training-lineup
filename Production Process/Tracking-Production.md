# Individual Production

Keeping track of one's production as a developer can be challenging.
There are several phases of the production process as well as multiple duties required of a developer.
It would be logical to assume that all that is required of a software developer is to solve the problems then write the code.
Unfortunately, there is a bit more required. The individual developer also plays a major part in maintaining the
coherency of any given project. That means keeping track of what needs to be done along with what has already been done.
And don't forget, no developer knows everything. There is also research time that must be accounted for.
Add to that production deadlines and you can see there is quite a bit of administration that goes along with development.

Any company engaged in software development has procedures and protocols for overcoming the challenges of
tracking production. The material presented here are the practices and procedures developed for K and R Software.
Other companies handle these issues a little differently.
Even so, you will find they are similar to other industry organizations.

## The Ticket System

Software projects are broken down into individual tasks. These tasks are then assigned to individual developers
to be completed. The means by which this is done is by the use of tickets. Tickets are very much like workorders.
They give the assignee information about what needs to be done, how long it should take, and a point value awarded
upon its completion. Here at K and R Software we use an application for this purpose called Redmine. (needs completion)

## Time

Time is a primary measure of production for most jobs. An employee punches a time clock and is then paid for the
time he is actually there. This has only limited workability in a development environment. This industry is largely
based on completing applications for clients.
The longer the application is not working in the hands of the client, the greater the costs to the company.
Time is certainly a factor, but getting the work done with excellent quality and reasonable speed is very much
senior to time spent in the development process.
