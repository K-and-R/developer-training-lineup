# The Back End

## What is the backend?

If the fron end is the control panel, what is the back end?
Let's look at this whole thing zoomed out a bit. first, we have two or more computers. They need or want to communicate.
How do we do this? We could just attach a cable between them.
That would dod the trick wouldn't it? Yes, that works just fine. But what if we want to connect to a computer further away?
What if we want to connect to more than one computer?
What if that computer is really far away as well?
What would we use to connect our computers?
Hmmmm, what connects electrical communication devices together? Well, we do have telephones that connect pretty
much everywhere. Can we use the phone wires?
Why yes, yes we can!. Great, now we can connect to
another computer over the phone lines.

## The Internet in a Nutshell

The internet is a group of computers connected to gether that is then connected to other groups of computers.
The internet is a network of smaller networks.
Your home network is connected to the internet through your router. This allows you to connect to other networks or
machines on those networks. It also allows other computers to connect to you. But why connect at all? The reason is to
facilitate communcation. If you are connected to another
computer on the internet, you can send and receive data
from that computer. That means you can access a website
and see the data stored there. It also means you can
store data on another computer and retrieve it later.
Basically, this is the value of the internet. It facilitates widespread communication. Special programs called browsers
allow a user to ask for data from a remote computer.
The browser can also receive and then interpret data
sent back to it in response to a request.
This is bascially what the browser does.
Lots of bells and whistles have been added over
the years, but in its most fundamental form that
is what a browser does.

## How It All Fits Together

We use HTML and CSS to tell the browser what a webpage should look like. We use javascript to allow users to make things
happen on the page itself. All of these "languages" are
for use in the confines of a browser program. But what about outside of the browser? The browser, in its basic form,
simply makes requests for data then translates the data
received onto your screen. Once a request made by a browser is received by another computer, that computer needs to know
what to do with that request. We can give it instructions,
but we need another language to do it. That is where server-side languages come in. Now, not confuse anyone, but you can
use JavaScript for this purpose. However, this was not
always the case. Because of this lag in time, other
languages have been used to write the instructions needed to transfer data from the "other computer"
(Ok, its a server I'm talking about, you got me).
Among the most common have been PHP, Ruby, or Python.
So, how does this work? Well, first you build your
website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
