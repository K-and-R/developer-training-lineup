# The Computer

From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the definition of a computer is " *a programmable usually electronic device that can
store, retrieve, and process data*.

Your computer is electronic. There have been other machines in the past that did not require electricity to operate.
However, that was a really, really, long time ago.

1. Read the definition above.
2. Make sure you understand all of the words in the definition.
3. Look up any words that you may have uncertainty about, then read the definition again.
4. DRILL: Locate the actual, physical object that is your computer.
5. DRILL: Examine the different parts on the physical unit itself, such as any buttons or holes or slots.
6. DRILL: Look over any symbols labeling these. Notice any wires or cables connected to the machine.

## Turning On the Computer

The computer has several different features built into it. In the last series of drills you located most, if not all, of
these. Each one has a specific function.  In this part a brief description of each of the more common features of a
computer will be described.

### The Power Button

The power button is located usually somewhere on the front portion of the computer. It is designated as a power button
by symbol that looks like a circle with a line segment inside of it. Pressing this button when the computer is off will
cause it to begin "booting up". Booting-up (or sometimes just referred to as "booting") is the process of the computer
preparing itself for you to use it.  Pressing the power button when the computer is on can cause different things to
happen, depending on the type of computer you have. Some computers simply switch off. Other computers will give you a
warning on the screen to tell you unsaved data will be lost. Other computers will simply ignore you. Using the power
button to turn off your computer is not recommended. There is another way to properly shut down your machine. We'll
cover this in the next segment.

*DRILL:* Use the power button to turn on your computer. If it is already on, skip this drill.

### Turning the Computer Off

Part of the function of a computer is to "remember" things. When you type data into the computer it will store that
information in its memory. When you tell the computer to save the information, the computer will store your information
in a form such that it can be retrieved again, even if you turn the computer off. So, there are two parts to a
computer's memory, one temporary and one that is somewhat "permanent". If you shut the computer off before you have
instructed the computer to save the information you have placed in its memory, that data will be lost. In order to
prevent this, your computer has a very simple procedure for shutting itself off.

* In the upper right corner of the computer screen you will see a small upside down triangle. Using the mouse, click on
* the triangle. A small rectangle will appear. Inside the rectangle you will see a list of items to select. Move the
* mouse so that the pointer is on the item Power Off/Log Out item. Click on this item. The rectangle will appear to get
* longer, and there are a few more items revealed. Click on the Power Off item in the extended list. The computer will
* be shutting down without any further actions required from you. Make sure you turn off your screen after the computer
* has fully shut down. The power button for the screen is usually on the lower right corner of the device.

## The Keyboard

The primary tool you will use to interact with the computer is the keyboard. Most people have some familiarity with a
keyboard. However, software developers need a more exacting knowledge of where the keys are and what they do. In this
next section we will cover where the keys are, what they do, and actions you can take to speed your interaction with the
computer. The main portion of the keyboard is contained in five rows starting with a row of number keys and ending with
the row containing the space bar. We will refer to these rows starting at 1 for the top row and counting down (The space
bar is on the 5th row, the numbers are on 1st row).

Note: Keyboards can be inconsistent. Not all keyboards have keys in the same place. Not all keyboards spell out the
names of the keys, and some may use all lower case or all upper case. We are using a very common keyboard as a refernce
for the information below.

Look over the keyboard. Notice there are several different keys in addition to the standard alphabet characters. We
will briefly explain some of the more unusual keys below:

* `Enter`

    - This key is located on the lower left of the keyboard. This key is used to enter data after you have typed it or
      to confirm a choice presented to you by the computer. Think of it as saying the word "GO". When you hit the enter
      key you are saying, "Ok, GO! Do it!".

    *DRILL:* Find the Enter key on the keyboard.

* `Shift`

    - This key is located in two different locations on the keyboard, usually in on the far lower left and far right of
      the keyboard.  Originally, this key was used to type a capital letter. These days, the Shift is used to change the
      function of what a key does in addition to capitalizing letters. The SHIFT key also renders alternative symbols.
      On several keys you will see two different symbols printed on one key. The first symbol will be rendered when the
      key is pressed. By holding down the SHIFT key and pressing the same key again the the second symbol will be
      rendered to the screen.

  *DRILL:* Find the SHIFT keys on the keyboard.

  *DRILL:*  Open a text file. Type a few lines on the screen. Use the SHIFT key to capitalize one or more letters. Find
            the number keys along the top of the keyboard. Hold down SHIFT and press a number key. Notice that the
            symbol, not the number, is rendered on the screen.

* `Delete`

    - This key is used to remove text from the screen. It is also used to discard information you don't want. It is the
      "throw this away" key. When typing text, the DELETE key removes letters from the right to the left. When the
      cursor is placed at the beginning of a line of text and the delete key is pressed, the letter directly to the
      right of the cursor will be removed. When the DELETE is held down letters will continue to be removed until the
      end of the line, and continue to do so for any successive lines.

  *DRILL:*  Open a text file (Click on the Notepad icon). Type a line of text. Use the DELETE key to remove it. Type
            another line. Place the cursor somewhere in the middle of the line and press the DELETE key. Continue this
            exercise until you feel comfortable using the DELETE key.

* `Caps Lock`

    * The CAPSLOCK key: When the CAPSLOCK key is pressed all letters typed will be rendered on the screen as capital
    * letters.

    * DRILL: Open a text file. Press the CAPSLOCK key. Type some lines of text. Press the CAPSLOCK key again. Type
    * another line of text. Notice the lowercase letters.

* `Backspace`

    * The BACKSPACE key: This key does the same thing as delete, but in reverse. Rather than removing letters or symbols
    * from the right of the cursor, it removes letters from the to the left of the cursor.

    * DRILL: Open a text file. Type a line of text. Place the cursor at the end of the line. Press the BACKSPACE key.
    * Notice it moves from the left to the right removing one letter. Press and hold the BACKSPACE key. Notice how the
    * process of removing letters from the screen is repeated. If there are any lines *above* the line the cursor is on,
    * these will be removed as well, and so on until the key is released.

* `Esc`
    - Called "escape".

* `Ctrl`
    - Called "control". This key is located in two different places. One to the far right of the bottom row, and another
      to the far left on the bottom row.

* `Alt`
    - This key is also located in two different places. One to the far right of the bottom row, and another to the far
      left on the bottom row.

    * SYMBOL keys: There are several keys used by developers that are not commonly used by the everyday computer user.
    * For now, all we want to do is make sure you know where they are. These keys can be in different places on
    * different keyboards. We will give you the general vicinity of the keyboard where they can be found. Some
    * manufacturers intentionally misplace some of these. The thinking seems to be that these keys are not generally
    * used by users. If you can't find the keys listed below in the general vicinity of where they are located, get a
    * different keyboard. The one you have is not for software development.

    * `` ` ``
        - Located the far left of the 1st row. This is called a "back-tick". It is used to change the way text appears
        on the screen or in some computer languages.

    * `/`
        - Located on the far right of the 4th row. This is called a "forward slash", or simply "slash". It is used in
          coding languages and to designate the path the computer needs to follow to find a specific file or folder.
          You will see this key in addresses for locating web pages on the World Wide Web.

    * `\`
        - Located above the `Enter` key. This is called a "backslash" key. It is used for text formatting within a file
        or in to designate the path the computer on the Windows operating system.

    * `~`
        - Located on the 1st row, far left. This key is called a tilde. It is used in coding languages and for
        formatting text files.

    * `|`
        - Located on the 2nd row, far right. This symbol has many names. For our purposes it is referred to as a
          "pipe". It is used for quite a few different things. We will cover its function more in depth in future
          lessons.

Locating the keys on the keyboard is crucial to gaining an ability to quickly and easily navigate around the environment
of the computer.

*DRILL:* Look at the keyboard. Locate each key listed above.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Computers existed before the advent of the mouse. In order to navigate around the computer or to implement specific
actions within the computer, developers have relied upon keyboard shortcuts. By using a combination of different keys
the user can execute various commands without the need of a mouse. This is often a great time saver. Over use of the
mouse is discouraged.

There are quite a few more of these shortcuts. You can find lists of these online. For now, these are a good place to
start.

* Alt + F : Shows the file menu options in the current program. Alt + E : Shows the edit menu for the currently selected
* window. Ctrl + A : Selects all text Ctrl + X : Cuts selected item. Ctrl + Del : Same as Ctrl + X. Ctrl + C : Copies
* the selected item. Ctrl + V : Pastes the selected item. Home : Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line. Ctrl +
* Home : Moves the cursor to the beginning of the page. Ctrl + End : Moves the cursor to the end of the page. End : Move
* to the end of the line. Shift + arrow key : Selects text in the direction of the arrow. Shift + End : Selects the
* entire line of text to the right of the cursor. Shift + Home : Selects all of the line to the left of the cursor.

### DRILL: Open a text file

Type of few lines. Using the list of shorcuts above, practice using each of the shortcuts.

## The Mouse

The mouse is a common feature on most computers today. This was not always the case. Before the advent of the mouse,
develpoers used the keyboard exclusively to input commands and perform actions on the computer. Developers generally
agree that, once the various keyboard commands are understood, utilizing them instead of the mouse is faster and easier
than using the mouse. While the mouse is not forbidden (It does make a few things more convenient) its' use is
discouraged in favor of the keyboard operation. There are a couple of points to cover here regarding the proper use of
the mouse.

* If there is a choice between using the keyboard and the mouse, use the keyboard. The left side of the mouse is used to
* confirm the entry of data, place the cursor in a particular position on the page, and select files or icons on the
* screen. the action of using the left side of the mouse is referred to as "left-clicking". Clicking the right side of
* the mouse will usually bring up an additional drop-down menu.

### DRILL: Open a text file or webpage

Use the mouse, testing out each function. When you feel comfortable using the drill is complete.
