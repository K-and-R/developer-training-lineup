# The Computer

From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the definition of a computer is " *a programmable usually electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data*. 

Your computer is electronic. There have been other machines in the past that did not require electricity to operate. However, that was a really, really, long time ago.

### Part 1A - Parts of the Computer
The computer has several different features built into it. In the last series of drills you located most, if not all, of these. Each one has a specific function.  In this part a brief description of ech of the more common features of a computer will be described.
1. The Power Button

 The power button is located usually somewhere on the front portion of the computer. It is designated as a power button by symbol that looks like a circle with a line segment inside of it. Pressing this button when the computer is off will cause it to begin "booting up". Booting-up (or sometimes just referred to as "booting") is the process of the computer preparing itself for you to use it.  Pressing the power button when the computer is on can cause different things to happen, depending on the type of computer you have. Some computers simply switch off. Other computers will give you a warning on the screen to tell you unsaved data will be lost. Other computers will simply ignore you. Using the power button to turn off your computer is not recommended. There is another way to properly shut down your machine. We'll cover this in the next segment.

 DRILL: Use the power button to turn on your computer. If it is already on, skip this drill.

 2. Turning the Computer Off

Part of the function of a computer is to "remember" things. When you type data into the computer it will store that information in its memory. When you tell the computer to save the information, the computer will store your information in a form such that it can be retrieved again, even if you turn the computer off. So, there are two parts to a computer's memory, one temporary and one that is somewhat "permanent". If you shut the computer off before you have instructed the computer to save the information you have placed in its memory, that data will be lost. In order to prevent this, your computer has a very simple procedure for shutting itself off.
