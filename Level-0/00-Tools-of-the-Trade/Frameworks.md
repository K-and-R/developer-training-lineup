# Frameworks

A framework is a foundation used to build applications. If you were to write the all of the code needed for a given app, it would take you a very long time. A framework helps you to short-cut some of the code writing required. It also has some features that assists you in the building process. You don't *have* to use a framework, but they are often used to speed production and organize your code. There are several different frameworks out there. They all do pretty much the same thing in different ways. The framework must be learned in addition to knowing the coding language it is built for. Once you have a good grip on how it works, you can build applications quickly and relatively easily.
