# Data Structures

A computer system exists primarily to mainpulate data. A computer system does not have an infinite amount of memory resources,
nor does possess instantaneous transport of data. Because of these facts, it is necessary to handle data being used in a
computer system in the most efficient way possible. By organizing our data and intelligently accessing that organization,
we can maximize the performance of the system. One of the tools utilized
to achieve this is the data structure. If we were to have a series of related values (like a number)
that have some relationship to each other (like test scores or ID numbers) it makes sense that we would group them
together in one place.
This is one use of a data structure. It is not inconceivable that a computer could store related data anywhere it wanted.
It is perfectly capable of retrieving that data even though it may be scattered all over the place. However, that takes time
and multiple calculations. These are not necessary if the data is grouped in a data structure. When so grouped the
computational and memory resources are protected from being over extended, and the system is capable of doing
more than it could when not so organized. An understanding of Data Structures is essential to good software development.
Lets cover some of the more relevant Data Structures.

## Terms

Before we get started, let's define some terms.

* `Data Structure`
    - A particular way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

Arrays can store values of any data type. It can also have multiple, different data types.
Each element of the array is assigned a number to identify its place in the collection.
The first element of an array has an index of 0.
