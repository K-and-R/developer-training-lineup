# The Computer

From the Merriam-Webster Dictionary the definition of a computer is " *a programmable usually electronic device that can store, retrieve, and process data*.

Your computer is electronic. There have been other machines in the past that did not require electricity to operate. However, that was a really, really, long time ago.

## Section A - The Computer

1. Read the definition above.
2. Make sure you understand all of the words in the definition.
3. Look up any words that you may have uncertainty about, then read the definition again.
4. DRILL: Locate the actual, physical object that is your computer.
5. DRILL: Examine the different parts on the physical unit itself, such as any buttons or holes or slots.
6. DRILL: Look over any symbols labeling these. Notice any wires or cables connected to the machine.

### Part 1A - Turning On the Computer

The computer has several different features built into it. In the last series of drills you located most, if not all, of these. Each one has a specific function.  In this part a brief description of each of the more common features of a computer will be described.

1. The Power Button

 The power button is located usually somewhere on the front portion of the computer. It is designated as a power button by symbol that looks like a circle with a line segment inside of it. Pressing this button when the computer is off will cause it to begin "booting up". Booting-up (or sometimes just referred to as "booting") is the process of the computer preparing itself for you to use it.  Pressing the power button when the computer is on can cause different things to happen, depending on the type of computer you have. Some computers simply switch off. Other computers will give you a warning on the screen to tell you unsaved data will be lost. Other computers will simply ignore you. Using the power button to turn off your computer is not recommended. There is another way to properly shut down your machine. We'll cover this in the next segment.

 DRILL: Use the power button to turn on your computer. If it is already on, skip this drill.

 1. Turning the Computer Off

Part of the function of a computer is to "remember" things. When you type data into the computer it will store that information in its memory. When you tell the computer to save the information, the computer will store your information in a form such that it can be retrieved again, even if you turn the computer off. So, there are two parts to a computer's memory, one temporary and one that is somewhat "permanent". If you shut the computer off before you have instructed the computer to save the information you have placed in its memory, that data will be lost. In order to prevent this, your computer has a very simple procedure for shutting itself off.

* In the upper right corner of the computer screen you will see a small upside down triangle. Using the mouse, click on the triangle.
* A small rectangle will appear. Inside the rectangle you will see a list of items to select.
* Move the mouse so that the pointer is on the item Power Off/Log Out item.
* Click on this item.
* The rectangle will appear to get longer, and there are a few more items revealed.
* Click on the Power Off item in the extended list.
* The computer will be shutting down without any further actions required from you.
* Make sure you turn off your screen after the computer has fully shut down. The power button for the screen is usually on the lower right corner of the device.

### Part 1B - The Keyboard

The primary tool you will use to interact with the computer is the keyboard. Most people have some familiarity with a keyboard. However, software developers need a more exacting knowledge of where the keys are and what they do. In this next section we will cover where the keys are, what they do, and actions you can take to speed your interaction with the computer. The main portion of the keyboard is contained in five rows starting with a row of number keys and ending with the row containing the space bar. We will refer to these rows starting at 1 for the top row and counting down (The space bar is on the 5th row, the numbers are on 1st row).

1. Look over the keyboard. Notice there are several different keys in addition to the standard alphabet characters. We will briefly explain some of the more unusual keys below:

* The Enter key: This key is located on the lower left of the keyboard. This key is used to enter data after you have typed it or to confirm a choice presented to you by the computer. Think of it as saying the word "GO". When you hit the enter key you are saying, "Ok, GO! Do it!".
* DRILL: Find the Enter key on the keyboard.
* The Shift key: This key is located in two different locations on the keyboard, usually in on the far lower left and far lower right of the keyboard.  Originally, this key was used to type a capital letter. These days, the Shift is used to change the function of what a key does in addition to capitalizing letters. The SHIFT key also renders alternative symbols. On several keys you will see two different symbols printed on one key. The first symbol will be rendered when the key is pressed. By holding down the SHIFT key and pressing the same key again the the second symbol will be rendered to the screen.
* DRILL: Find the SHIFT keys on the keyboard. Open a text file. Type a few lines on the screen. Use the SHIFT key to capitalize one or more letters. Find the number keys along the top of the keyboard. Hold down SHIFT and press a number key. Notice that the symbol, not the number, is rendered on the screen.
* The DELETE key: This key is used to remove text from the screen. It is also used to discard information you don't want. It is the "throw this away" key. When typing text, the DELETE key removes letters from the right to the left. When the cursor is placed at the beginning of a line of text and the delete key is pressed, the letter directly to the right of the cursor will be removed. When the DELETE is held down letters will continue to be removed until the end of the line, and continue to do so for any successive lines.
* DRILL: Open a text file (Click on the Notepad icon). Type a line of text. Use the DELETE key to remove it. Type another line. Place the cursor somewhere in the middle of the line and press the DELETE key. Continue this exercise until you feel comfortable using the DELETE key.
* The CAPSLOCK key: When the CAPSLOCK key is pressed all letters typed will be rendered on the screen as capital letters.
* DRILL: Open a text file. Press the CAPSLOCK key. Type some lines of text. Press the CAPSLOCK key again. Type another line of text. Notice the lowercase letters.
* The BACKSPACE key: This key does the same thing as delete, but in reverse. Rather than removing letters or symbols from the right of the cursor, it removes letters from the to the left of the cursor.
* DRILL: Open a text file. Type a line of text. Place the cursor at the end of the line. Press the BACKSPACE key. Notice it moves from the left to the right removing one letter. Press and hold the BACKSPACE key. Notice how the process of removing letters from the screen is repeated. If there are any lines *above* the line the cursor is on, these will be removed as well, and so on until the key is released.
* SYMBOL keys: There are several keys used by developers that are not commonly used by the everyday computer user. For now, all we want to do is make sure you know where they are. These keys can be in different places on different keyboards. We will give you the general vicinity of the keyboard where they can be found. Some manufacturers intentionally misplace some of these. The thinking seems to be that these keys are not generally used by users. If you can't find the keys listed below in the general vicinity of where they are located, get a different keyboard. The one you have is not for software development.
* ( ` ) - Located the far left of the 1st row. This is called a "back-tick". It is used to change the way text appears on the screen or in some computer languages.
* ( / ) - Located on the far right of the 4th row. This is called a "backslash" key. It is used in coding langauges and to designate the path the computer needs to follow to find a specific file or folder. You will see this key in addresses for locating web pages on the World Wide Web.
* \ - Located on the 2nd row, far right. This is called a "forwardslash" key. It is used for text formatting within a file.
* ( ~ ) - Located on the 1st row, far left. This key is called a tilde. It is used in coding languages and for formatting text files.
* ( | ) Located on the 2nd row, far right. This symbol has many names. For our purposes it is referred to as a "pipe". It is used for quite a few different things. We will cover its function more in depth in future lessons.
* CTRL - This key is located in two different places. One to the far right of the 5th row, and another to the far left on the 5th row.

DRILL: Finding Keys on the Keyboard.

Locating the keys on the keyboard is crucial to gaining an ability to quickly and easily navigate around the environment of the computer.

* Look at the keyboard.
* Locate each key listed above.

### Part 1C - Keyboard Shortcuts

Computers existed before the advent of the mouse. In order to navigate around the computer or to implement specific actions within the computer, developers have relied upon keyboard shortcuts. By using a combination of different keys the user can execute various commands without the need of a mouse. This is often a great time saver. Over use of the mouse is discouraged.

* Alt + F : Shows the file menu options in the current program.
* Alt + E : Shows the edit menu for the currently selected window.
* Ctrl + A : Selects all text
* Ctrl + X : Cuts selected item.
* Ctrl + Del : Same as Ctrl + X.
* Ctrl + C : Copies the selected item.
* Ctrl + V : Pastes the selected item.
* Home : Moves the cursor to the beginning of the line.
* Ctrl + Home : Moves the cursor to the beginning of the page.
* Ctrl + End : Moves the cursor to the end of the page.
* End : Move to the end of the line.
* Shift + arrow key : Selects text in the direction of the arrow.
* Shift + End : Selects the entire line of text to the right of the cursor.
* Shift + Home : Selects all of the line to the left of the cursor.

DRILL: Open a text file. Type of few lines. Using the list of shorcuts above, practice using each of the shortcuts.

There are quite a few more of these shortcuts. You can find lists of these online. For now, these are a good place to start.

### Part 1D - The Mouse

The mouse is a common feature on most computers today. This was not always the case. Before the advent of the mouse, develpoers used the keyboard exclusively to input commands and perform actions on the computer. Developers generally agree that, once the various keyboard commands are understood, utilizing them instead of the mouse is faster and easier than using the mouse. While the mouse is not forbidden (It does make a few things more convenient) its' use is discouraged in favor of the keyboard operation. There are a couple of points to cover here regarding the proper use of the mouse.

* If there is a choice between using the keyboard and the mouse, use the keyboard.
* The left side of the mouse is used to confirm the entry of data, place the cursor in a particular position on the page, and select files or icons on the screen. the action of using the left side of the mouse is referred to as "left-clicking".
* Clicking the right side of the mouse will usually bring up an additional drop-down menu.

DRILL: Open a text file or webpage. Use the mouse, testing out each function. When you feel comfortable using the drill is complete.

## The Browser

A browser is a piece of software on your computer. It allows you to make requests for information from the World Wide Web. When that information is returned to the browser it will assemble the information into the format specified by instructions from the webpage itself. We will cover the parts of the browser and how to use it to view web pages on the internet.

### Internet Protocol Address (IP)

Your specific machine has an identification number unique to it. This is called an IP address. This is your "home" address. Data that you request from the internet is delivered to you using this address. It is usually a set of four groups of numbers each separated by ".". As the internet has grown the number of IP addresses has also increased. Such was the increase that we ran out of four unit sets of numbers. To solve this problem a new standard for IP addresses has come into use. This one uses a larger set of numbers. You may see both of these written as IPv4 and IPv6 respectively. All it means is *Internet Protocol version 4* or *Internet Protocol version 6*. You can find the IP address of your machine by opening a terminal window and typing: hostname -I. You can also open your browser and type "What is my ip" in the search bar. The browser will tell you your IP addess.

### Domain Names

A domain name is an actual name of something substituted for the IP address. IP addresses are just sets of numbers. You can think of a domain name as an alias for the IP address number. Instead of saying. "I would like to connect with 172.16.254.1, please" you can say, "Connect me to Bobby's house." Bobby's house and the IP address number is the same thing. One is a human readable name and the other is the number associated with it. Domain names are organized in a heirarchy starting with regions and going down to individual machines and locations on the internet. Suffixes like .com or .edu are known as top-level domain names. These govern regions of types of locations. A suffix like .gov is concerned with goverenment information. A suffix of .edu is concerned with the subject of education. This is used to keep things organized. The most common Top Level Domain name is .com. This means "commercial". It is used by websites that are doing business online. However, any website can use the .com TLD name. The Top Level Domain is concerned with grouping areas of the internet together based on the type of content the website has. So, if you had a URL like My_Page.com, the ".com" means the website is out there on the public internet. The "My_Page" part is the alias for the IP address of your website.

### Uniform Resource Locator

* Every web page on the internet has a specific location where it can be found.
* This location, or "address", is called a Uniform Resource Locator, or URL. It tells the browser where to look for a particular web page.
* The browser is often confused with a search engine. These are actually different things.  A search engine is a website that lists the locations of other websites. Once you find what you are looking for, you still have to tell your browser use the URL to request the data. This is a little deceptive because in order to "use the URL to locate the data" is really just clicking on the listing in the search engine. Even though it is deceptively simple, it is important to understand that the simple click on a search engine listing is, actually, a request from the browser for information located at a specific address (URL).
* If you know the URL of the resource you wish to view, you can skip the search engine altogether. All you need to do is enter the URL in the window at the very top of browser window. The information will be requested, returned, and assembled for you just as if you had clicked on a search result. And it's faster using the search engine.
* Search engine pages are often displayed as the first thing you see when you open your browser. This is partially the reason why there has been some confusion between the two.
* The URL address has parts to it just like the address for your house. It is a good idea to know what each of these parts are when using a URL. Here they are:
  * HTTP or HTTPS: This means Hyper Text Transfer Protocol or Hyper Text Transfer Protocol . A Protocol is a set of rules to be used by the browser when requesting and receiving information.
  * : - This comes right after the HTTP or HTTPS. It has a purpose, but getting into it will confuse you. For now, just know it is needed and where it goes.
  * // - This is a double-slash. Again, there's reasons for it, but it will confuse you. The specifics of these symbols will be covered in later modules. For now, just know its needed, and it comes after the :.
  * www.domain name : This is the actual address of where your website is located.

After the domain name you may see additional / marks and names of things. This is a file path. It is the road to travel to arrive at the specific file you are requesting.  There are quite a few other symbols in there too. We will cover these in a later module. For now, the basic form of the URL is all you need.

The URL window is located at the very top of the browser screen. Usually just below it is the search window. The search window is for searching for a website. The URL window is for times when you already know where you want to go (In other words, you already have a URL available to you).

## Servers

The term "server" can be very confusing to new developers. Even some more experienced developers are a little fuzzy on the subject. Here, we will try to keep it very simple.

Server: A piece of computer hardware *or* software that provides functionality to other programs or devices.

That definition covers a lot of ground. Let's break it down a little further. A server *serves* a *client*. Think of a restaurant. The server is the waiter and the diner is the client. The diner orders what he wants to eat and the waiter goes and gets it for him. Ah, but wait! There's more. What if it was a very fancy restaurant? In this case, you might have a different waiter for each item you wanted. There might be a wine waiter and dessert waiter and table setting waiter and so on. Well, that's how it works with computers as well. There can be (and often are) several different types of servers depending on what you want to do. There can file servers for files and web servers for web pages, and database servers for databases, etc. Because there can be so many servers of different types and functions, it's much easier to think with the most basic expression of what a server is. It is a machine or a package of software that does something for you when you tell it to. It can live on a machine located far away from you or it can live on your machine itself. A computer can be *both* a client and a server. The server part is the software that gets or does something for you when you make a request for it to do so. Usually, however, the server is located on a different machine living somewhere else. Your computer (the client) communicates to the server. The server then responds to your request by sending you data or performing a task. As a Web Developer, you will work with servers everyday.

### Localhost

As stated above, one computer can operate both as a client and as a server. When using localhost you are using your computer both as the client and the server. This server does not have access to the rest of the internet. Localhost is used in the development process when working on a web based project that requires a server component, but you don't want just anyone on the internet accessing it.
You can store your own webpages on your computer and call them up again using localhost.  You access the localhost by typing "localhost" into the URL window in your browser.

## Text Editors

Where do I write the instructions to tell the computer what I want it to do? This question is apparently considered to be a very stupid question indeed. It is actually very difficult to get a straight answer to this. If you look on the internet for the answer, you will find a myriad of different answers and explanations. Few of them actually answer anything for the new developer. So, we will attempt to give a simple answer to this simple question. Let's begin at the beginning.

Long ago, there was no such thing as a "development environment" or a "framework" or "text editors".  There was only the humble file. A file is the digital equivalent of a piece of paper. That is all that it is. It is a blank page that you can write computer instructions in. So, how does the computer know that this piece of paper is something the computer is supposed to read and then do? Simple. *You* tell it to. That's right, you tell the computer that this piece of paper is something that the computer should read and execute when you tell it to do so. How do you tell it this? By using a *file extension*. A file extension is a ( . ) followed by a series of letters. These letters tell the computer what kind of file your instructions are. By use of file extensions the computer knows what to do with that file. There are many different types of file extensions. The ones you will work with the most are likely extensions like .html or .css or .js. By placing the file extension at the end of the file name you are telling the computer what kind of file it is. It can then figure out what to do with it when you tell it to execute the instructions.

Working with just a blank file has its disadvantages. You have to write everything you want the computer to do. You have to keep track that everything written in the file is written correctly. You are responsible to ensure your code is formatted so that it can be clearly read. You get no help from the computer to ensure your file is being written correctly or that it is formatted clearly. Sometimes your code must be repetitive or you find the same block of code must be reproduced elsewhere in your file. This can be tedious and waste time better spent on actualy development. In order to solve some of these problems, developers over the years have created programs that allow you to write your code, help you format it correctly, point out any errors, and keep your files organized. All this is done by the program so you don't have to do it yourself. The simplest of these are called text-editors.

### What Does A Text Editor Do?

Text editors are like a package of tools that help you to write code. They can organize files, point out errors, automatically format lines of code, and a lot of other things. The purpose of a text ediotr is to allow the developer to get on with developing without having to handle all of the minor details that go along with that activity. They also provide some very helpful tools that directly assist you as you develop your programs. There are several different types of text editors. We suggest you begin with a text editor called Sublime. It is easy to learn and use almost right away. It also has the advantage of being very customizable. As you become more familiar with the text editor environement, you may find that you like using certain tools and settings more than others. Sublime allows you set up your working area in the manner which suits you best, and makes it easy to do so.

Text editors are not just for writing code files. You can edit, create, and modify any type of text-based file. You could use a text editor to fix that letter to grandma or create a shopping list. The point is text editors are not just for code. However, it just so happens that this is what they are normally used for. But you can pull out any text file in your text editor and modify it. It is really just a glorfied Notepad.

Lets open up the text editor and see some of the basic functions:

* Go to the Sublime website. There you will find instructions on how to download Sublime on your machine. Our primary platform is Linux Ubuntu 20.04, so you will want to find the instructions for that Linux distribution.
* Once you have Sublime downloaded onto your machine, just click on the icon for Sublime to open the text editor.
* Go to the menu bar at the top of the screen. Click on File. A menu will drop down giving you several options. Click on Open Folder. Now, select a folder you want to open.
* The folder will appear in a bar on the left. Any folders inside the main folder will also be visible. Just click on the left pointing arrows to show the contents of the folder.
* Now double click on the file you want to open.
* That's it. The contents of the file should be visible on the screen.
* Now you can add text or make other changes to the file. Then save the file and your changes will be kept.

When you open a file that has a code file extension, like .js or .html, the computer and the text editor know that the file is a code file. Your text editor will automatically apply a feature of your code editor called "text highlighting". Text highlighting changes to color of different pieces of text in the editor depending on what that code represents. A variable may be written in red while a string may be rendered in blue. This is a fast, handy way for you to see all the parts of your code at the same time. It also provides a clue for times when you might be writing your code wrong. You may expect to see a few words of your code turn red when you have declared a variable, but it doesn't. Looking more closely, you will find your syntax is in error. Hence, the color of the text doesn't change. After awhile, you'll get kind of addicted to text highlighting.....just like everyone else has. You can change the way the text highlighting is rendered, or you can turn it off completely. This feature is so widespread in software development that the vast majority of developers use it in one form or another. The colors used for various parts of your code carry over to everyone else's code as well. Therefore, it is advised that you don't change the colors from the ones already used by the text highlighter.

### Frameworks

A framework is a foundation used to build applications. If you were to write the all of the code needed for a given app, it would take you a very long time. A framework helps you to short-cut some of the code writing required. It also has some features that assists you in the building process. You don't *have* to use a framework, but they are often used to speed production and organize your code. There are several different frameworks out there. They all do pretty much the same thing in different ways. The framework must be learned in addition to knowing the coding language it is built for. Once you have a good grip on how it works, you can build applications quickly and relatively easily.

### Intergrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE is a set of tools all grouped in one application used by the developer to handle every aspect of software development. Everything from file management to error handling to security is handled within an IDE. This is very different from a text editor. Your text editor is really just that, an editor for writing and editing text. Many text editors have similar features to an IDE, but not anywhere near to the extent of an IDE. IDE's are not usually needed for web development work. For now, we will just use the Sublime Text Editor.

### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine is a computer that is created by your computer. It behaves exactly as though it were a completely separate computer running on its own. It is not connected in anyway to your computer. It does not have access to any of your files or applications (unless you let it). Think of a virtual machine as a computer created by your computer that functions as a separate machine. The virtual machine *does* depend on your computer's CPU and it borrows some memory from it. This makes sense because memory and the CPU are hardware that a computer cannot function without. Other than that, a virtual machine is a totally separate machine running on your machine.

These are used when you want to isolate applications from outside access. They are also used for security purposes and when you want to run a different operating system but don't want to get rid of the operating system you are already using. You can just install the different OS on the virtual machine. The downside of virtual mchines is that they do use CPU and memory resources from your actual machine. As a result of this, you may experience some slow down of your computer when running one or more virtual machines.
