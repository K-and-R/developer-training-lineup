# What is a Developer

A develper is someone who creates computer programs that help people complete tasks using a computer.
However, that is only a very basic view of the job of software developer. There are different levels of developers.
Some specialize in certain parts of development. Others handle the whole development process. Still others oversee and
manage the development process. In this section we will go over some of the different aspects of being a software developer.

## Introduction

The only reason anyone uses a computer to do anything is because that machine helps solve a problem.
But who decides what problem needs solving? Who determines how that problem should be solved? Usually, these
questions are answered by a group of software developers.
In order to be effective it is logical that different members of a development team would be assigned different tasks
on a project. These can be broken down into three levels of skill. There are lots of ways of organizing members
of a team. The description given here is only one of these.
However, unlike many other organizational hierarchies this one seeks to give you some idea of what tasks are
assigned to which developers and why. For further information regarding the various roles assumed by a software
developer please see (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPbE7BssOs>) `Rethinking the Developer Career Path -

## The Junior Developer

A Junior Developer is the person who writes the code. She doesn't necessarily define the problem or decide
on the means by which the problem should be solved. She is simply given the solution and told to translate that solution
into the analogous block of code. It doesn't mean that she has no input or that she shouldn't understand the problem she
is being tasked to write code for. It means that her job is primarily to translate a solution into code.
You could think of a Junior Developer as the workperson on site.
They hammer the nails and hang the drywall and maybe paint the handrails by the stairs.
But they don't design the house or oversee their fellow workers or decide which nails to use.
They are the implementers of solutions.

## Tech Lead

This is a mid-level position in the team. The Tech Lead solves problems. This description is a bit vague.
What does "solves problems" mean exactly?
The Tech Lead would accept from the client whatever the client wanted the computer to do and translate that into a
logical plan of how to get it done. She would then break the solution down into pieces. Each piece is then handed off
to a Junior Developer to write the code.
She is responsible for ensuring her team of Junior Developers understand what is expected of them and helps them
should they encounter any difficulties with their assigned tasks. She is also responsible for coordination
between her developers and management personnel above her. Her skills must include not only coding,
but also personnel management and liasion duties.

## The Senior Developer

After a period of time spent writing code and solving problems, a developer begins to see the sources of problems before
they occur. He can predict what problems will be encountered before the project even begins. You could think of
the Senior Developer as the creator of new applications that solve problems heretofor unrecognized as problems.
You could also think of him as an architect of computer applications. Tech Leads and Junior Developers assist him in bringing
his new ideas from conception to reality.

## Progression

Given the classifications above, how do you move forward from one level to the next?  Let's take a look at the
means to move forward as a developer.

## Duties of the Junior Developer

As already mentioned above, a Juniro Developer is largely responsible for translating solutions into code.
She doesn't solve problems. Instead, she translates already formulated solutions into code. That's it.
It is not her job to decide *how* a problem is solved.
Her only concern is writing the code to implement the solution. For example, a Tech Lead has decided that a button is
needed on the user interface page. So, she tells her Junior Developer, "Make a button and put it in the upper
left corner of the page. When clicked, it should show a menu.". All the Junior Dev is interested in is creating that button
and writing the function needed to show the menu. She is not concerned with *why* the button is needed or whether
or not a button is the best solution. She is only concerned with doing what has been asked.

That sounds like the Junior Dev is some sort of monkey or minion. However, it should be remembered
that even though her only
job is to write code, she is still a highly skilled professional. After all, if she doesn't know her
job then nothing happens at all. Her contribution is therefore vital to the development process. But how does she
move forward? After having implemented a
variety solutions in a wide sphere of different areas, she has gained enough knowledge and experience
to be able to determine for herself what solutions best solve what problems. That sounds alot like a Tech Lead, doesn't it?
So, to move forward our Junior Dev would need to have the opportunity to implement solutions in code that cover a wide
variety of different areas.
In contrast, a Junior Developer can spend a very long time, sometimes years, implementing only a
very small number of solutions. Though this Junior Dev has been
doing this for a long time, they are still lacking the experience of having implemented a larger number of solutions to a
wider variety of different problems. The point here is this :
Time on the job is not an accurate metric for promotion. Junior Developers should seek out different types of problems in
different aspects of the development process. It is not required that the Junior Developer *solve* the problems.
It is only required that she gain experieince in implementing given solutions in code.

## Duties of the Tech Lead

The Tech Lead is responsible for solving the specific problems presented by clients. Once the solutions are arrived at, she
then breaks the solution down into smaller, specific tasks.
These are then delegated to her team of Junior Developers. Once she has delegated these tasks to her team, she is now
responsible for overseeing the work being done. So, how does she move forward into a Senior Developer position?

This is very similar to the Junior Developer. The more problems the Tech Lead solves, the more she can anticipate what kinds
of problems she might encounter in the future. The goal here is to be able to take an abstract idea and translate that idea
into a working application. The more varied the problems,
the broader the experience gained by the Tech Lead. Again, none of
this has anything to do with time served.
She can solve the same problems over and over again for years,
and not being any closer to competently moving
forward into a Sr. Dev postion. She is required to have experience solving a wide variety of problems and successfully
implementing those solutions via her Junior Developer teams.
She then will be confident to move forward into a Sr. Developer position.

## The Duties of the Senior Developer

The role of the Senior Developer encompasses all of the above plus a bit more. They have had quite a bit of experience
writing code, solving problems, and implementing solutions. The difference here is the Sr. Developer envisions the overall
purpose of any given application in terms of its contribution to the overall aims of the organization from which it has
originated. He looks for the problems resident in the application. He knows these are problems because they do not forward
the aims of the company or organization as a whole. He has a very broad, top-level view of the production. In addition to
finding problems, the Sr. Dev also has the ability to break the problem down into smaller, more managable pieces. He could,
if needed, even write the code that solves the problems he has found.
In short, he can do it all. One of the significant differences between the Sr. Dev and the Tech Lead is one of scope.
The Tech Lead is concerned with immediate problems presented regarding specific aspects of the project. She handles solving
those problems and then delegating the implementation of the solutions to her Junior Devs. The Senior Developer does much
the same thing, except his scope is more broad. He looks at the bigger picture and in so doing anticipates what hurdles must
be overcome in order to deliver a product that is in alignment with the aims of the organization. He is fully capable of
solving these problems and can implement thier solutions.

## Something to Remember

It is important to bear in mind the above descriptions are what *should* be the way a team operates. They are not the way
most teams *actually* operate. There is quite a lot of
confusion regarding the delegation of duties and
the ranking of job titles
in this industry. Executives that really have no
idea what a developer does often make the
mistake of assuming a Junior Dev
should be able to do what a Sr. Dev does.
There are lots of job titles given to employees in various companies.
Many have their
own job descriptions.
There is no set standard for any of this.
The information offered above is only for the purpose of
giving you a more clearly defined overview of
the duties of each level of software development.
Your experience may vary (and probably will).
