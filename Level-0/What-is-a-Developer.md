# What is a Developer

A develper is someone who creates computer programs that help people complete tasks using a computer.
However, that is only a very basic view of the job of software developer. There are different levels of developers.
Some specialize in certain parts of development. Others handle the whole development process. Still others oversee and
manage the development process. In this section we will go over some of the different aspects of being a software developer.

## Problem Solving

The only reason anyone uses a computer to do anything is because that machine helps solve a problem.
But who decides what problem needs solving? Who determines how that problem should be solved? Usually, these
questions are answered by a group of software developers.
In order to be effective it is logical that different members of a development team would be assigned different tasks
on a project. These can be broken down into three levels of skill. There are lots of ways of organizing members
of a team. The description given here is only one of these.
However, unlike many other organizational hierarchies this one seeks to give you some idea of what tasks are
assigned to which developers and why. For further information regarding the various roles assumed by a software
developer please see (<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylPbE7BssOs>) `Rethinking the Developer Career Path -

## The Junior Developer

A Junior Developer is the person who writes the code. She doesn't necessarily define the problem or decide
on the means by which the problem should be solved. She is simply given the solution and told to translate that solution
into the analogous block of code. It doesn't mean that she has no input or that she shouldn't understand the problem she
is being tasked to write code for. It means that her job is primarily to translate a solution into code.
You could think of a Junior Developer as the workperson on site.
They hammer the nails and hang the drywall and maybe paint the handrails by the stairs.
But they don't design the house or oversee their fellow workers or decide which nails to use.
They are the implementers of solutions.

## Tech Lead

This is a mid-level position in the team. The Tech Lead solves problems. This description is a bit vague.
What does "solves problems" mean exactly?
The Tech Lead would accept from the client whatever the client wanted the computer to do and translate that into a
logical plan of how to get it done. She would then break the solution down into pieces. Each piece is then handed off
to a Junior Developer to write the code.
She is responsible for ensuring her team of Junior Developers understand what is expected of them and helps them
should they encounter any difficulties with their assigned tasks. She is also responsible for coordination
between her developers and management personnel above her. Her skills must include not only coding,
but also personnel management and liasion duties.

## The Senior Developer

After a period of time spent writing code and solving problems, a developer begins to see the sources of problems before
they occur. He can predict what problems will be encountered before the project even begins. You could think of
the Senior Developer as the creator of new applications that solve problems heretofor unrecognized as problems.
You could also think of him as an architect of computer applications. Tech Leads and Junior Developers assist him in bringing
his new ideas from conception to reality.
