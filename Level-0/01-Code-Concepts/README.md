# Code Concepts

In this section we will cover the tools of the developer and some of the methods of their use.

## Definitions

These files will contains the definitions of common terms a developer would be expected to understand. Make sure you
understand all of the words in the definitions. If, in reading a defintion, you encounter any other words or symbols
that you have uncertainty about, look up those words or symbols then read the definition again.

## Drills

Along with a description of various practices and tools there are several simple drills. These drills help give a small
amount of hands-on application of the concepts discussed.
